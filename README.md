# Knowledge-Graph-Building-From-Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`test.ipynb`) that provides a practical guide to understanding and building a Knowledge Graph (KG) from unstructured text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## What is a Knowledge Graph?

A Knowledge Graph is a structured representation of information that describes interlinked entities and their relationships. At its core, a KG consists of:

  * **Nodes (Entities):** Representing real-world objects, concepts, or events (e.g., "Germany," "Holy Roman Empire," "1815").
  * **Edges (Relationships):** Representing the connections or associations between entities (e.g., "began in," "inhabited," "formed in").

The smallest unit in a Knowledge Graph is often referred to as a "triple," which comprises two entities connected by a single relationship (e.g., `(Germanic tribes, inhabited, region)`).

## Why Build a Knowledge Graph?

Knowledge Graphs are powerful tools for:

  * **Enhanced Search:** Providing more relevant and contextual search results.
  * **Data Integration:** Connecting disparate data sources.
  * **AI Applications:** Powering intelligent applications like recommendation systems, chatbots, and question-answering systems.
  * **Semantic Understanding:** Enabling machines to understand the meaning and relationships within data.

## How to Build a Knowledge Graph from Text

The `test.ipynb` notebook demonstrates a step-by-step approach to extracting information from text and transforming it into a structured Knowledge Graph. This process primarily leverages various NLP techniques:

1.  **Sentence Segmentation:** Breaking down raw text into individual sentences.
2.  **Dependency Parsing:** Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences to identify relationships between words.
3.  **Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging:** Identifying the grammatical role of each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
4.  **Entity Recognition:** Identifying and classifying key entities within the text.

The notebook provides practical examples and Python code using popular NLP libraries to illustrate these concepts.

## Notebook Highlights

  * **Introduction to KGs:** Clear definitions of nodes, edges, and triples.
  * **NLP for KG Construction:** Explanation of essential NLP techniques like dependency parsing, POS tagging, and entity recognition.
  * **Code Examples:** Practical Python code snippets demonstrating how to implement these techniques.
  * **SpaCy Integration:** Utilizes the spaCy library for efficient linguistic processing.
  * **Relationship Extraction:** Illustrates how to extract meaningful relationships between entities from text.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook and explore the code:

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```
3.  Install the necessary libraries (e.g., `spaCy`, `pandas`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
4.  Open the `test.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab test.ipynb
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook test.ipynb
    ```

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different texts, and adapt it for your own Knowledge Graph projects\!
